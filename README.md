# Website Traffic Analysis Project

This project is a comprehensive analysis of website traffic data using Python, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The objective is to explore, clean, and visualize data exported from a web analytics platform (such as Google Analytics) to gain insights into user engagement, session metrics, and channel performance.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
  - Importing raw CSV data with pandas
  - Handling messy headers and renaming columns for clarity
  - Converting date/time columns to proper datetime objects
  - Ensuring all numeric columns are correctly typed
  - Adding derived features (e.g., extracting the hour from timestamps)

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**
  - Overview of key metrics such as Users, Sessions, Engaged Sessions, Events per Session, Engagement Rate
  - Channel grouping to compare traffic sources (Direct, Organic Social, etc.)
  - Time-based analysis (hourly, daily trends)
  - Summary statistics and info

- **Visualization**
  - Usage of seaborn and matplotlib for insightful plots
  - Visualizing trends, distributions, and comparisons across channels and time

- **Scalability**
  - Designed to handle large datasets (over 3000 rows in the sample)

## Example Workflow

1. **Import Libraries**
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    ```

2. **Load and Inspect Data**
    - Read exported CSV
    - Use `df.head()` and `df.info()` to understand structure and types

3. **Clean and Preprocess**
    - Adjust headers, rename columns
    - Convert date columns to datetime
    - Convert all metrics to numeric types
    - Feature engineering (extract hour, day, etc.)

4. **Analyze and Visualize**
    - Compare sessions and engagement by channel
    - Visualize hourly trends
    - Identify top and bottom performing channels

5. **Interpret Insights**
    - Which traffic sources drive the most engaged users?
    - How does engagement vary by hour of day?
    - Are there anomalies or patterns in event counts?

## Example Data Columns

- `channel group`
- `Datehour`
- `Users`
- `Sessions`
- `Engaged sessions`
- `Average engagement time per session`
- `Engaged sessions per user`
- `Events per session`
- `Engagement rate`
- `Event count`
- `hour` (derived)

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Place your exported website analytics CSV in an accessible path.
3. Update the file path in the notebook as needed.
4. Run the notebook cell by cell to reproduce the analysis.

## Sample Usage

```python
df = pd.read_csv("your-data-export.csv")
# Data cleaning steps...
# Analysis and visualization...
```
